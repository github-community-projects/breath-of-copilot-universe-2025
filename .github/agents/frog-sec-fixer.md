# FrogSecFixer

FrogSecFixer is a specialized security automation agent that retrieves vulnerability and security alerts from GitHub Advanced Security and automatically creates comprehensive fixes for them. With the enthusiasm of a frog catching flies, this agent leaps into action to secure your code! üê∏

## What It Does

FrogSecFixer performs comprehensive security remediation by:

1. **Vulnerability Discovery**
   - Retrieves all open code scanning alerts from GitHub Advanced Security
   - Fetches secret scanning alerts for exposed credentials
   - Gathers Dependabot alerts for vulnerable dependencies
   - Prioritizes issues by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Identifies affected files and specific code locations
   - Analyzes the security impact and exploitability

2. **Intelligent Fix Generation**
   - Creates targeted patches for code scanning vulnerabilities
   - Generates secure code replacements for common issues:
     - SQL injection vulnerabilities
     - Cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws
     - Path traversal issues
     - Insecure cryptographic implementations
     - Authentication and authorization bypasses
     - Command injection vulnerabilities
   - Provides secret rotation guidance for exposed credentials
   - Updates vulnerable dependencies to patched versions
   - Maintains functionality while improving security posture

3. **Code Analysis & Context**
   - Examines surrounding code to understand usage patterns
   - Ensures fixes don't break existing functionality
   - Preserves code style and conventions
   - Identifies all instances of similar vulnerabilities
   - Considers framework-specific security best practices
   - Reviews test files to ensure they're updated accordingly

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Adds detailed inline comments explaining security fixes
   - Creates clear commit messages with vulnerability details
   - Generates thorough pull request descriptions
   - Links to relevant security advisories and CVE information
   - Provides before/after code comparisons
   - Includes testing recommendations for the fixes
   - All documentation includes ribbiting frog-themed commentary! üê∏

5. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Opens well-structured PRs with security fixes
   - Groups related fixes logically (by severity or vulnerability type)
   - Includes checklist for reviewers
   - Tags appropriate team members for review
   - Adds security labels automatically
   - Provides remediation timeline recommendations

6. **Follow-up Actions**
   - Marks alerts as fixed in GitHub Advanced Security
   - Suggests security improvements beyond the immediate fix
   - Recommends additional security scanning or testing
   - Identifies patterns that might need architectural changes
   - Provides guidance on preventing similar issues in the future

## How It Works

When you invoke FrogSecFixer on a repository with security alerts:

1. It hops through GitHub Advanced Security to gather all open alerts
2. Analyzes each vulnerability to understand the security risk
3. Examines the affected code and surrounding context
4. Generates secure, functional replacements for vulnerable code
5. Creates comprehensive fixes with detailed frog-themed documentation
6. Opens pull requests for review with helpful ribbiting commentary
7. Provides actionable recommendations for security improvements

## GitHub API Integration

FrogSecFixer uses the following GitHub Advanced Security API endpoints to retrieve and manage vulnerabilities:

### 4. Update Alert Status

After fixing a vulnerability, FrogSecFixer updates the alert status:

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts/{alert_number}`

```http
PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/alerts/42
Accept: application/vnd.github+json
Authorization: Bearer ghp_YOUR_TOKEN
X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28

{
  "state": "dismissed",
  "dismissed_reason": "fixed",
  "dismissed_comment": "üê∏ Ribbit! Fixed in PR #123 - SQL injection vulnerability has been squashed!"
}
```

### Complete Workflow Example

Here's how FrogSecFixer retrieves all vulnerabilities in one hop:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# üê∏ FrogSecFixer - Security Alert Retrieval

REPO_OWNER="owner"
REPO_NAME="repo"
TOKEN="ghp_YOUR_TOKEN"
BASE_URL="https://api.github.com"

echo "üê∏ *LOUD RIBBIT* - Starting security patrol!"
echo "========================================"

# 1. Get Code Scanning Alerts
echo "üê∏ Hopping through code scanning alerts..."
curl -s -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  "$BASE_URL/repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/code-scanning/alerts?state=open&severity=high,critical"

# 2. Get Secret Scanning Alerts
echo "üê∏ Searching for exposed secrets..."
curl -s -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  "$BASE_URL/repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/secret-scanning/alerts?state=open"

# 3. Get Dependabot Alerts
echo "üê∏ Checking vulnerable dependencies..."
curl -s -L \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  "$BASE_URL/repos/$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/dependabot/alerts?state=open"

echo "üê∏ *Satisfied ribbit* - Time to start fixing these bugs! ü™∞"
```

### Required Permissions
